This was my lab 1 for my Feedback Control Class. I have includes graphs and a MATLAB file. 
Lab 1 consisted of controlling a lightbulb based on its temperature. When the lightbulb reached
a specific temperature, the solid state relay would turn off the lightbulb so it could cool 
down below the desired temperature and then turn it back on. The process would repeat for 
the desired amount of time.
